tsnake is a simple terminal snake game written in C++ with ncurses.
Move the snake with the arrows, with wasd or with vim keys (hjkl).
It starts with a speed of 1 cells/sec and every 20 points the speed
is increased by one until the maximum speed of 15 cells/sec is reached.
The speed can be increased (+) and decreased (\-) during gameplay if
cheat mode is enabled.
The game has a few maps which can be activated using the \fB\-m\fR option.
Maps are cycled automatically when the game is restarted.
