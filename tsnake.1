.SH SYNOPSIS
.B tsnake
[\fI\,OPTION\/\fR]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
Description:
tsnake is a simple terminal snake game written in C++ with ncurses.
Move the snake with the arrows, [wasd] or [hjkl].
Use [p] to pause game, [r] to restart it with a new map and
[q] to quit.
The game starts with a speed of 2 m/s and every 20 points the speed
is increased by one m/s until a maximum of 20 m/s.
If cheat mode is enabled (\fB\-\-cheat\fR), the speed can be increased and
decreased with [+] and [\-].
The game has a few maps which can be chosen using the \fB\-m\fR option.
Otherwise, maps are cycled automatically when the game is restarted.
